## About

This project is still work in progress.

## Other implementations

There are other SockJS implementations for Haskell (under construction), the two I know of are:

* https://github.com/yihuang/wai-sockjs
* https://github.com/bitonic/sockjs-haskell

This project was originally fork of Yihuang's work (check out [this branch](https://github.com/Palmik/wai-sockjs/tree/old)).
I have also toyed with Bitonic's code (check out [this branch](https://github.com/Palmik/wai-sockjs/tree/old2)).

I have borrowed some of their ideas, but the project itself is a rewrite from the ground up.
