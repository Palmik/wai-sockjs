## About

## Other implementations

There are other SockJS implementations for Haskell (under construction), the two I know of are:

https://github.com/yihuang/wai-sockjs
https://github.com/bitonic/sockjs-haskell

This project was originally fork of Yihuang's work (you can find that code on the branch 'old').
I have also toyed with Bitonic's code (you can that code on the branch 'old2').
Now the project is independent of these two.
